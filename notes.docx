1. Its calculating the risk of properties depending on their location, designing new architecture development, planning shipment of goods, and finding possible routes between different locations.
2. Geospatial data is typically stored in two possible formats : Raster and Vector

Raster : Represents data as a matrix of pixels (therefore having a fixeed resolution). In this representation, each pixel can be assigned a different
        value and multiple grids stacked together can be used in order to augment even more the same image. For example, the same image could be stored 
        using 3 channel/bands(e.g. RGB = Red, Green, Blue) or with a single channel.

Vectors : Can be used to abstract geometrics of the real-world using elements such as points, lines, polygons, etc.. and they can usually be stored in conjunction
        with some useful metadata about the objects they are representating (e,g. name, address, owner, etc..). Since they are stored as mathematically objects, it is 
        possible to zoom in on vectors without compromising resolution

Working with Geospatial data, many different forms of operations/transformations are usually required.

    Conversion from non-tabular / raw binary formats to vector/raster.

    Bucketing continuos data into discrete categories.

    Extracting polygons / features from data.

    Handling no data and outliers.

    Reprojecting in different coordinate systems.

    Generating lower resolution overviews of data to handle different zoom levels
    and not overloading rendering or images.


Geo Panda : Is an open-source library specifically designed to extend pandas capabilities to handle 
            Geospatial data.

Well-known text (WKT) : Is used as the text markup language for representating our vector geometry
                        objects but other formats can generally be used such as GeoJson.
